# HzLoad
HorizonM launcher and terminator application

`HzLoad` is licensed under the `MIT` license. See `LICENSE` for details.


## Current features
* launches HzLoad when the launcher terminates
* if the B or X button is held it'll kill HzLoad instead of launching it


## Building
- instlall devkitARM (bundled with [devkitPro](http://devkitpro.org))
- `make && make HIMEM=1`

## Getting started
- Install `HzLoad.cia` (or `HzLoad_HIMEM.cia` for extended memory games for the old3DS)
- Open `HzLoad` or `HzLoad HIMEM`

> Note: currently the HIMEM version doesn't auto-transition to the Home Menu, you have to do it manually. Hold the Home button every 10seconds for a second. If it doesn't go to the Home Menu in a minute, force power-off as it may have just softlocked APT. Select a game, and press A twice (first A to open the game, second A to confirm close)
